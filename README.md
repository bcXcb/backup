## Best practices for naming directories and files

* Avoid spaces between compound names, use techniques such as: hyphen (bar-foo), flat-case (barfoo) or snake-case (bar_foo); pascal-case (BarFoo) and camel-case (barFoo) are not recommended;

* Avoid accents and non-alphanumeric characters, prioritize alphanumeric characters from the ASCII table (0-9, a-z without an accent, A-Z without an accent);

* Avoid capital letters, ideally they should all be written in lower case.

Note: The above rules do not apply to native directories or files, as they already come with the system and it makes no sense, nor should you rename them.
